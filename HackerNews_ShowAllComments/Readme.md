## Hacker News - Show All Comments

**Deprecated**: Userscript is deprecated. This feature has finally been added natively to Hacker News.

---

On comment detail pages, adds a link back to the whole Hacker News thread.

On Hacker News, there is no easy way to get back to the remaining thread from a comment page. This can be clunky if you land on a deep comment (e.g. from a Google search) and want to see all other comments.
